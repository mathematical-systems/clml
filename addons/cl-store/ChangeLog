	* sbcl/custom.lisp: be lenient when parsing parts of sbcls version string. Thanks to Gustavo.
	* default-backend.lisp: faster serializing of (simple-array
	unsigned-byte 8). Thanks to Chris Dean

2007-01-26 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp : Checked in a fix for non sb32 integers, certain 
	large number numbers where incorrectly serialize. 
	Reported by Cyrus Harmon.
	* plumbing.lisp: Added a new function alias-backend and alias the backend
	'cl-store:cl-store as :cl-store
	
	
2007-01-23 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* circularities.lisp: Renamed with-grouped-serialization to with-serialization-unit
	and added two keyword args to allow removal of *grouped-restore-hash* and 
	*grouped-store-hash* special vars as exported symbols.
	* default-backend.lisp: Changed defvars of register-types to defparameters.

2007-01-22 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* utils.lisp, circularities.lisp, tests.lisp 
	* stop store-32-bit from creating an intermediary object
	which reduces the consing (on at least Lispworks 5.0 and SBCL 'Kitten of Death').
	* export 4 new symbols which allows more efficient serialization of values.	
	create-serialize-hash, with-grouped-serialization, *grouped-store-hash*
	and *grouped-restore-hash*.
	* conditionalize some forms which were preventing ABCL from running the tests.
	
	
2006-12-16 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

	* utils.lisp, acl/custom.lisp, cmucl/custom.lisp, lispworks/custom.lisp
	sbcl/custom/lisp, default-backend.lisp, cl-store.asd: 
	Committed handling for serialization of float types short, single, double and
	long and handling of positive infinity, negative infinity and NaN for all
	float types (this is still only for sbcl, cmucl, acl, and lispworks).

2006-12-11 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

	support for structure object storing for OpenMCL.
	Thanks to Kilian Sprotte for the code.
	* default-backend.lisp, utils.lisp: Changed creation

	* package.lisp: Added imports for MCL (from Gary King)
	* backends.lisp: Changed definition of the defstore-? and
	defrestore-? macros to work with lispworks dspecs.
	* default-backend.lisp: Fixed the *sbcl-readtable* to copy
	the default readtable.
	* plumbing.lisp: Changed cl-store-error to extend directly from error
	and removed error from restore-error and store-error's precedence list.
	 
2005-10-06 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* backends.lisp: Fixed type definition for 
	compatible-magic-numbers from integer to list.
	Reported by Bryan O'Connor.
	
2005-10-04 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

2005-09-20 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

	of CLISP with a MOP.
	* default-backend.lisp: Fixed storing of long lists.
	 (Reported by and help by Alain Picard)
	* default-backend.lisp: New magic number, due to the
	change in approach of storing lists, although previous
	files can still be restored.
	
2005-05-18 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* utils.lisp: Removed awhen
	* backends.lisp: Added a compatible-magic-numbers slot.
	* default-backend.lisp: misc cleanups.

2005-05-06 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* backends.lisp: Added optional errorp argument
	to find-backend (default false).
	* default-backend.lisp: Changed simple-string storing
	to keep the upgraded-array-element-type of the 
	restored string the same as the string which was stored.
	This seems to give a performance boost (more in memory usage) 
	with SBCL and Lispworks.
	* circularities.lisp: Stopped binding *stored-values*  
	and *restored-values* when circularity checking is inhibited.
	* doc/cl-store.texi: Miscellaneous fixes.
	
2005-05-05 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* all: After much experimentation with Lispworks I
	discovered that globally declaiming unsafe code is
	not a good idea. Changed to per function declarations.
	* default-backend.lisp: Removed lispworks unicode string
	test as it was incorrect.
	
2005-03-24 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

	* plumbing.lisp: Added error to the superclasses
	of restore-error and store-error.

	*restore-hash-size* to more reasonable values (50).
	
2005-03-17 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* doc/cl-store.texi: Fixed up to work properly with makeinfo.
	
2005-03-15 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp, utils.lisp: Changed reference
	to array-dimension-limit in array storing to 
	array-total-size limit.
	* default-backend.lisp: Added an implementation specific 
	test to determine whether or not a string contains unicode
	characters.
	
2005-02-26 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp: Fixed internal-store-object
	for the hash-table class (argument order was messed).
	
2005-02-18 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>

	* package.lisp, utils.lisp, default-backend.lisp: Patch 
	from Thomas Stenhaug which changed get-slot-details to 
	a generic-function so that it can be customized.
	Added serializable-slots (returns a list of slot-definitions)
	which can be overridden to customize which slots are
	serialized when storing clos instances.
	
2005-02-16 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp, package.lisp, plumbing.lisp: Patch

2005-02-14 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp: Applied patch from Thomas Stenhaug
	to default null superclasses of a restored class to 
	standard-object as this caused errors in Lispworks.
	
2005-02-11 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	New Magic Number for cl-store-backend.
	* default-backend.lisp, acl/custom.lisp, lispworks/custom.lisp
	* sbcl/custom.lisp, cmucl/custom.lisp:
	Changed storing of floats to be compatible between implementations
	while ensuring that NaN floats and friends are still serializable.
	* backends.lisp, plumbing.lisp:
	Added concept of backend designators which can be a 
	symbol (the backend name) or the backend itself. These are 
	acceptable replacements for a backend object
	to store, restore and with-backend.
	Completely changed argument order for generic functions
	to ensure that backends are the first argument.
	* ecl/mop.lisp: Added support for ecl.
	* plumbing.lisp: Removed multiple-value-store (I don't really
	see the point of it).
	* backends.lisp: Changed the working of object restoration
	from functions in a hash-table (restorer-funs of a backend)
	to generic functions specialized on backend and a symbol,
	removed find-function-for-type. 
	* plumbing.lisp: Changed the handling of the stream-type
	of backends to be any legal type designator since it's 
	only used when opening files.
	* backends.lisp: Both defstore-? and defrestore-?
	can take an optional qualifer argument.
	
2005-02-03 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* default-backend.lisp: Fixed hash-table restoration,
	it no longer assumes that the result of hash-table-test
	is a symbol but treats it as a function designator.
	* default-backend.lisp: Added various declarations
	to help improve speed.
	
2005-02-01 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* various: Large patch which has removed pointless 
	argument-precedence-order from various gf's, added the 
	start of support for ecl, renamed fix-clisp.lisp file to 
	mop.lisp, and changed resolving-object and setting 
	to use delays allowing get-setf-place and *postfix-setters*
	to be removed.
	
2004-12-02 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
	* sbcl/custom.lisp, cmucl/custom.lisp: Changed the evals when restoring
	structure definitions to (funcall (compile nil ...))

	with symbols with no home package.
	* sbcl/custom.lisp: Support for structure definitions from defstruct.
	* tests.lisp: Tests for structure definitions.
	* circularities.lisp: Optimization for referrers and values-object's.
	Added *store-hash-size* and *restore-hash-size* which can be bound
	to reduce the calls to rehash which conses like crazy.
	Added *check-for-circs* which can be bound to nil to stop
	checking for circularities which reduces consing drastically but objects
	will not be eq and will hang on circular objects (see README).
	* default-backend.lisp: New Magic Number ,again.
	Cater for SB! package names for built-in function names
	in SBCL.
	
2004-11-10 Sean Ross <sross@common-lisp.net>
